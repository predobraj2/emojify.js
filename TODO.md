## General
* Create a proper build script with options
* Delete *.png images

## Javascript
* Add configuration options, like maybe allow user to specify a tag and an attribute and emojify would only work on that tag.
* Another configuration option: turn regex off for say, emoticons, or people, or other parts.
* Make this a jQuery plugin, somehow I have a feeling this is pretty easy
