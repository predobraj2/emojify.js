# To Do

## CSS
* Decide whether to use one large image and base64-encode it or encode each icon individually
* Make sure CSS accounts for smileys being used in normal text

## Javascript
* Figure out a better way of inserting the image into the markup, rather than "dumb" insertion - also causing <p> tags to mess up
* Add configuration options, like maybe allow user to specify a tag and an attribute and emojify would only work on that tag.
