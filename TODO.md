## General
* Create a proper build script with options
* Delete *.png images
* Make configuration method accept a JSON object

## Javascript
* Add configuration options, like maybe allow user to specify a tag and an attribute and emojify would only work on that tag.
* Make this a jQuery plugin, somehow I have a feeling this is pretty easy
