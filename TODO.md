# To Do

## CSS
* Make sure CSS accounts for smileys being used in normal text

## Javascript
* Figure out a better way of inserting the image into the markup, rather than "dumb" insertion - also causing <p> tags to mess up
	Maybe just save class attribute in array instead of markup, and have a function which creates <div> tags and inserts them into the DOM
* Add configuration options, like maybe allow user to specify a tag and an attribute and emojify would only work on that tag.
* Another configuration option: turn regex off for say, emoticons, or people, or other parts.
* Make this a jQuery plugin, somehow I have a feeling this is pretty easy
